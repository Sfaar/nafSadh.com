	Hello!
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	I am Sadh. Okay, my full given name is Khan Muhammad Nafee Mostafa Sadh – pretty long, huh? 
	May be, and yes, because of it, I end up being called by different names: Khan, 
	Sadh or even Nafee. I prefer to be addressed as Sadh or Khan. 
	<p/>

	In a nice dawn on October 10, I screamed for the first time and the world said me 
	welcome with a beaming soft sunlight amidst the quiet of the nice town of Tangail.
	Soon I became the source of smile for my mom Nasrin A. and dad G. Mostafa Khan. I 
	started to play a lot, draw pictures, watch cartoons, read stories and soon at the 
	age of 3 years found myself accompanied by a sweet little sister Shuchi. 
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	I got my first schooling at “Town Government Primary School, Tangail”; 
	in those days, I used to rush on the streets all over my neighborhood riding my 
	favorite bicycle and played cricket. As days passed, I started going to “BinduBasini 
	Govt. Boys’ High School”, which has earned fame across the state by teaching students 
	from 1880 A.D. I feel proud of this school and met the most amazing group of friends
	there. 
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	In the year of 2003, I appeared in my first public examination from BinduBasini 
	and completed secondary school education. Afterwards, I moved to Dhaka and went 
	to B&nbsp;N&nbsp;M Rifles Public School and College. There, I met few nice fellows; 
	I also met friends from other colleges of the city and eventually completed my 
	higher secondary education in 2005.
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	In the following year, I decided to pursue an engineering degree majoring in 
	Computer Science and went to Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET). 
	At KUET I studied several aspects of computing technology and completed 
	several successful student projects. I worked on ‘intelligent&nbsp;home’ 
	with Ratul, Srijon and Rizel under supervision of Prof. MMA Hashem 
	and developed the INTELOME (showcased in BASIS&nbsp;SofExpo&nbsp;2008). Later, 
	with Ratul we worked on ‘automated traffic jam recognition using image 
	processing’. This project was named ‘Traffic Window’ and been supervised 
	by Rushdi Shams. Next, I along with Parvej, Ratul and Sourav formed the 
	PSSR Web Engineers group and worked on a project codenamed ‘SeaLand’. 
	This project targeted at developing a community web service that benefit 
	both professional and personal aspects of life. My undergraduate thesis 
	was on Semantic Web co-authored with Ratul and Sourav and supervised by 
	Rushdi Shams. We suggested a framework called RS2 (stands for 
	‘RDF by Structured Reference to Semantics’) that will process the 
	web documents and produce machine readable format in RDF collaborated 
	with the OWL (Web Ontology Language). It will help in fulfilling the 
	dream to introduce next generation web, Web 3.0 of the Giant Global Graph. 
	I enjoyed problem solving with the aid of computer programming. I was 
	lucky to attend an ACM ICPC Dhaka Regional Contest event in 2007 and 
	secured the 11th place. 
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	I really had four wonderful years at KUET, most colorful and certainly 
	most memorable four years of my life. I resided in Fazlul Haque Hall 
	and passed a lot of time hanging out with my friends. They included a 
	lot of wonderful people from whom I learned a lot, about life and world. 
	I also have been active in several important roles around the campus. 
	I have served as general secretary of Fazlul Haque Hall’s Hall Committee 
	and the Class Representative of KUET CSE 2k5. I was the General Secretary 
	of IEEE Student Branch at KUET. 
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	After graduating from KUET in 2010, I came back to Dhaka. Right then, 
	Samsung was forming its R&D hub at Dhaka and I joined with them. It was 
	a new and different experience, with a small group of different people. 
	But, soon, the company started to grow and it managed to hire about 
	six hundred engineers in following three years. Indeed more than just 
	a few of my friends from KUET also joined there. A corporate workplace 
	might not be always perceived as a fun place; but many amazing people 
	worked there and yes, we had good times beside the work chores. In 
	three years I made friends, and most luckily met my wonderful fiancé, 
	Sampreeti.
	<p/>
	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	I had my undergraduate degrees, and I was thinking about having a 
	Master’s degree. So, I applied for some programs in 2013 and enrolled 
	in MS in Computer Science program at Stony Brook University, NY. 
	In Fall last year, I flew to America and started to live in Long Island. 
	The town I lived in is really beautiful one and the school is a true 
	cosmopolitan hub of education.

	<p class="readable-text text-justify">
	In winter or 2014-15, I <a href='http://http://its-our-wedding.com/'>married</a>
	my then fiancé, Sampreeti, with whom I live in the village of Mineola. Besides 
	trying to be a husband and watching YouTube, I also work as a Software Engineer
	for a software company in Islandia, NY.
